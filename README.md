A **secure, role-based Payroll Management System** designed to automate employee salary processing, tax deductions, and payroll reporting.  
Built using **modern full-stack development practices** with a focus on **scalability, clean architecture, and real-world business logic**.

Payroll systems are **mission-critical enterprise applications** used by every organization.  
This project demonstrates my ability to design and build **business-critical software** with:

- Real payroll calculations  
- Role-based access control  
- Secure data handling  
- Modular and scalable backend design
